\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

\paragraph{} I would like to thank Lukas Bernhard, who was my supervisor at QuoScient GmbH\footnote{https://www.quoscient.io/}. Thanks to his continuous support and guidance that enabled me to finish this work. This work would have been impossible without him. I also learned and improved several programming and other concepts from him. He had been a great mentor.
\paragraph{} I would also like to thank Prof Dr Nils Gruschka, who agreed to be my supervisor at the University of Applied sciences Kiel and provided me his support throughout the course of this internship.
\paragraph{} I would like to thank Fabien Dombard (CEO of QuoScient) who gave me the freedom and support to work in an independent manner.
\paragraph{} I would thank Patrick Ventuzelo\footnote{https://github.com/pventuzelo} whose suggestions and understanding of the topics in Mobile security helped me.
\paragraph{} Lastly, thanks to all QuoScient team who supported me at one time or another and this work would have been impossible without them.
