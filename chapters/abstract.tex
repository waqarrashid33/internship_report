	\paragraph{} Today an ever growing number of population is using smartphones for their day to day tasks like social media, financial or other personal tasks. This fact hadn't gone unnoticed from the cyber-criminals and they are coming up with newer ways to bypass current security defenses to infect devices with like banking malwares, crypto miners, adwares etc. Android having more than 80\% of merket share is a prime target and due to the huge number of apps that needs to be analyzed the current malware analysis tools can use some enhancements.
	
	\paragraph{} In this project we focused on static and dynamic analysis of Android applications. Data from this analysis can be used to compare sample with previously analyzed samples and apply other algorithms on this data. We used androguard for static analysis. For dynamic analysis we used CuckooDroid. We fixed several issues in CuckooDroid and made some enhancements.
	
	\paragraph{} We also identified several areas in which future work can be done for example, frida integration with CuckooDroid, Enhancing anti-emulator detection capabilities of CuckooDroid, separating malicious and android API methods from static analysis data, improving performance of android emulator.
