\chapter*{\centering Abstract}
	\paragraph{} Today an ever growing number of population is using smartphones for their day to day tasks like social media, financial or other personal tasks. This fact hadn't gone unnoticed from the cyber-criminals and they are coming up with newer ways to bypass current security defenses to infect devices with banking malwares, crypto miners, adwares etc. Android having more than 80\% of market share, is the prime target and due to the huge number of apps that needs to be analyzed every day the current android malware analysis tools are not completely up to the tasks of automatic scalable malware analysis.
	
	\paragraph{} To address the issues of automatic malware analysis, in static analysis we extracted data from an APK file and showed that how that extracted data can be used to identify malicious samples. For dynamic analysis we used CuckooDroid. We fixed several issues in CuckooDroid and made some enhancements. We also made a pull request to CuckooDroid official repository.
	
	\paragraph{} We also identified several areas in which future work can be done for example, frida integration with CuckooDroid, Enhancing anti-emulator detection capabilities of CuckooDroid, separating malicious and android API methods from static analysis data, improving performance of android emulator and latest Android support in CuckooDroid.
