		\todo{Introduce androguard}
		Androguard is an open source tool written in python for analyzing android applications. Its been in a several of tools including Virustotal and Cuckoodroid among others. It can process APK files, dex files or odex files. It can disassemble Dex/Odex files to smali code and can decompile Dex/Odex to Java code. The classes in androguard can be generally divided into two categories: Classes used for parsing and the analysis classes. We will go into more details about these classes but first we will show some basic usage of androguard.
